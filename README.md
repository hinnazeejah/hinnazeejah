ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Hinna!
ðŸŽ“ Senior at St. John's University, studying Cybersecurity Systems
ðŸ”­ Aspiring Security Engineer and Machine Learning and Car Enthusiast

I love tackling real-world problems through data analysis and predictive modeling. Iâ€™m big on continuously learning and building my skills, and believe taking initiative is key to growth. I recenlty wrapped up an internhip at Rivian as a Cybersecurity Analyst and I am also building machine learning models and learning more about cybersecurity. Iâ€™m looking to leverage and grow my skills in a full-time role where I can contribute to exciting projects and learn from industry professionals- got any leads? Let me know!


ðŸŽ¯ Featured Project: ML-based web attack classification project for TANNER (*[link your project README](https://github.com/hinnazeejah/tanner/tree/main/ml_dataset))
What I Did: Built a machine learning-powered system that replaced traditional regex-based detection methods, significantly improving both accuracy and efficiency. I engineered a comprehensive dataset, performed extensive preprocessing, and trained multi-label classification modelsâ€”achieving a 94% accuracy rate using a Random Forest classifier.
Tools: Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, TF-IDF, Random Forest
Result: Achieved 94% model accuracy, replacing manual rule-based detection with an automated, intelligent classification system ready for production use.
