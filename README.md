# 👋 Hi, I'm Hinna!

🎓 Senior at **St. John's University**, majoring in **Cybersecurity Systems**  
🔭 Aspiring **Security Engineer**, **Machine Learning Developer**, and **Car Enthusiast**

I love tackling real-world problems through data analysis and predictive modeling. I’m big on continuously learning and building my skills, and believe taking initiative is key to growth. I recently wrapped up an internship at **Rivian** as a **Cybersecurity Analyst**, where I worked on third-party risk assessments and supplier monitoring. Outside of that, I’m actively building machine learning models and deepening my understanding of cybersecurity tools and threat intelligence platforms.

I’m currently looking for a **full-time opportunity** where I can contribute to innovative security projects and continue learning from industry professionals — got any leads? Let’s connect!

## 🎯 Featured Project: ML-Based Web Attack Classification for TANNER  

**What I Did:**  
Built a machine learning-powered system that replaced traditional regex-based detection methods, significantly improving both accuracy and efficiency. I engineered a comprehensive dataset, performed extensive preprocessing, and trained multi-label classification models—achieving a **94% accuracy** rate using a **Random Forest** classifier.

**Tools:** `Python`, `scikit-learn`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `TF-IDF`, `Random Forest`  
**Result:** Replaced manual rule-based detection with an automated, intelligent classification system ready for production use.
