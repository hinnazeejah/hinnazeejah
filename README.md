# Hi, I'm Hinna!

I'm a recent graduate of **St. John's University** with a degree in **Cybersecurity Systems**!

I love working on problems through data analysis and predictive modeling. I’m big on continuously learning and building my skills, and believe taking initiative is key to growth. I recently wrapped up an internship at **Rivian** as a **Cybersecurity Analyst**, where I worked on third-party risk assessments and supplier monitoring. I am now an intern for the **FBI**! Outside of work, I’m actively building machine learning models and deepening my understanding of cybersecurity tools and threat intelligence platforms.

## Featured Project 1: Foundation Models for Satellite Image Intelligence  

**What I Did:**  
Collaborated on a machine learning research project focused on classifying icebergs vs. vessels in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. Contributed to feature extraction and embedding workflows, compared baseline ML models with pretrained foundation-model embeddings (ViT and ConvNeXt), and supported evaluation and benchmarking to identify the most effective approach for maritime object detection.

**Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras, HuggingFace Transformers, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter  
**Result:** Achieved **96% classification accuracy** and **98.5% ROC-AUC** using a baseline MLP model. Demonstrated that while pretrained embeddings improved feature representation, a strong baseline model best met business and performance requirements for this task.

## Featured Project 2: ML-Based Web Attack Classification for TANNER  

**What I Did:**  
Built a machine learning-powered system that replaced traditional regex-based detection methods, significantly improving both accuracy and efficiency. I engineered a comprehensive dataset, performed extensive preprocessing, and trained multi-label classification models—achieving a **94% accuracy** rate using a **Random Forest** classifier.

**Tools:** `Python`, `scikit-learn`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `TF-IDF`, `Random Forest`  
**Result:** Replaced manual rule-based detection with an automated, intelligent classification system ready for production use.

## Featured Project 3: Pneumonia Detection System  

**What I Did**  
Developed a medical imaging AI system using EfficientNet to analyze chest X-ray images for pneumonia detection with 94%+ accuracy. I trained the model on open datasets, optimized it for Apple Silicon (MPS), and built a CustomTkinter GUI for user-friendly, real-time diagnosis.  

**Tools:** Python, PyTorch, PIL, CustomTkinter  
**Result:** Delivered sub-second inference speed and a pink-themed diagnostic interface designed for research, education, and preliminary screening.
